           <h2><b>About Sikkim</b></h2><br>
           <p style="color: #000000;">Sikkim was a Buddhist kingdom under the Namgyal-Chogyal dynasty from 1642 to 1975. Time and again the little kingdom had to defend itself against attacks from Nepal. 1835 the area of Darjeeling that had been part of Sikkim until then was annexed by British India. Sikkim was a protectorate first of British India and after its independence in 1947 of India. With foreign policy and national defense in the hands of India the political influence of Sikkim became more severely restricted when the new Constitution came into force in 1955. Bureaucrats planned to bring the monarchy to an end in 1973 and India in turn, increased its influence. The Chogyal (king who governs with righteousness) Palden Namgyal Thodup was crashed in 1975 and Sikkim merged with India as its 22nd state.</p>
           <p style="color: #000000">After the merger of Sikkim into the Indian mainstream, the work load in the department increased manifold and the department did not have proper infrastructure and manpower to deal with the growing work load. The Government invited Mr. M .V. Desai, the then Director of Indian Institute of Mass Communication, New Delhi, to give a report on the information task in Sikkim in 1977. Based on this Report, different sections like Publication, Advertising and Visual Publicity, District Information Office, Photo Division etc. were created and the required manpower trained in the Indian Institute of Mass Communication. Thus, the Department was made fully prepared to face new challenges. (Source: Evolution of the Fourth Estate in Sikkim -Sikkim’s Raj Bhawan, 2011).</p>
           <h2><b>Sikkim Today</b></h2><br>
           <p style="color: #000000">In 2001, the department started publishing SIKKIM TODAY, a quarterly magazine with the sole objective of highlighting and showcasing all the developmental programs, schemes and success stories of the various policies and initiatives of the state government.
           SIKKIM TODAY is widely distributed to Chief Ministers of all the States, Central and State Ministers, Embassies of different countries in New Delhi and Kolkata, Secretaries of all State and Central Government, District Offices, Schools, Colleges, Gram Vikas Kendra, Gram Prashashan Kendra, NGOs, and local public in the State.</p><br>
